      <h2>When to use a card</h2>
      <p>Use a card to provide users with a brief summary of content or a task, often with a link to more detail. Cards are frequently displayed alongside other cards to group related content or tasks.</p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>Cards should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information.</p>
      <p>They can contain multiple elements, such as an image, title, text and links.</p>

      <h3>Basic card</h3>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/basic.html" %}
      </div>

      <h3>Clickable card</h3>
      <p>For cards that contain a single link, the hit area for that link can be made to wrap the entire card.</p>
      <p>We avoid wrapping an entire card in an anchor tag as this can be a difficult experience for a screen reader user.</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/clickable.html" %}
      </div>

      <h3>Card with an image</h3>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/image.html" %}
      </div>
      <p>By default, the card image is set as a <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/content#use-alternative-text-for-images-in-content">decorative image</a>, with the alternative text being null.</p>

      <h3>Card group</h3>
      <p>Multiple cards can be grouped to display a collection related topics.</p>
      <p>You should prioritise the cards so the content users most need to know comes first.</p>
      <p>We define the width of the cards using the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/styles/layout#grid">grid system</a>.</p>
      <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">For example, <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-half</code> is used to make the cards half width:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="nhsuk-grid-row">
    <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-full">

      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/card-group-half.html" %}
      </div>

      <p>For thirds use <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-third</code>:</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/card-group-third.html" %}
      </div>

      <p>For quarters use <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-quarter</code>:</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/card-group-quarter.html" %}
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="nhsuk-grid-row">
    <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds">

      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      
      <h3>Heading level and size</h2>

      <p><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/design#use-headings-correctly">Make sure your headings reflect the page structure</a> by changing the level of the heading.</p>
      <p>Here's an example of replacing the default <code>h2</code> heading with a <code>h3</code>:</p>
      
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/accessibility-heading.html" %}
      </div>

      <p>You can change the size of the heading using <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/styles/typography#headings">heading typography styles</a>.</p>
      <p>Here's an example of using a <code>h3</code> with a <code>nhsuk-heading-s</code> class to reduce the heading size:</p>

      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/accessibility-heading-class.html" %}
      </div>
