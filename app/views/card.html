      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/issues/159">panel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/issues/91">promo</a> are two components in the <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend">NHS.UK frontend</a> that do not have guidance in the service manual. They both also share a lot of the same structure and design. This has confused users of the design system, with people not knowing when and how to use the components.</p>
      <p>The content of the current promo component is all contained within a link (anchor tag) and this can be a <a href="https://designsystem.gov.au/components/card/rationale/#cards-as-links">difficult experience for screenreader users</a>.</p>
      <p>We are proposing to combine the two components into one new component (card), add guidance to the service manual and improve the accessibility with new code.</p>

      <h2>When to use a card</h2>
      <p>Use a card component to provide a brief summary of content or a task, often with a link to more detail.</p>

      <h2>Card variations</h2>

      <h3>Basic card</h3>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/basic.html" %}
      </div>

      <h3>Clickable card</h3>
      <p>When using the clickable card, you place a link within the card heading, and add the class <code>nhsuk-card--clickable</code> to the parent level <code>nhsuk-card</code>.</p>
      <p>When this class is applied, it will trigger some JavaScript and users will be able to click the entire card.</p>
      <p>If the JavaScript is not available the card will fallback to only the heading link being clickable.</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/clickable.html" %}
      </div>

      <h3>With image</h3>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/image.html" %}
      </div>

      <h3>With footer link</h3>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/footer-link.html" %}
      </div>

      <h3>With multiple links</h3>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/multiple-links.html" %}
      </div>

      <h3>With metadata</h3>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/metadata.html" %}
      </div>

      <h3>With heading caption</h3>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/heading-caption.html" %}

  </div>
  <div class="nhsuk-grid-row">
    <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-full">

      <h3>Card group</h3>
      <p>Define the width of the cards using the <a href="#">grid system</a>.</p>
      <p>To make the cards the same height regardless of content you add <code>nhsuk-card-group</code> to the row and <code>nhsuk-card-group__item</code> to the column.</p>
      
      <p>Here's an example of using <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-half</code>:</p>
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/card-group-half.html" %}

      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">

      <h2>Changing the heading level and size</h2>

      <p>You can change the level of the heading to <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/design#use-headings-correctly">make sure your headings reflect the page structure</a>.</p>
      <p>Here's an example of replacing the default <code>h3</code> heading with a <code>h2</code>:</p>
      
      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/accessibility-heading.html" %}
      </div>

      <p>You can change the size of the heading using <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/styles/typography#headings">heading typography styles</a>.</p>
      <p>Here's an example of using a <code>h2</code> with a <code>nhsuk-heading-l</code> class to reduce the heading size:</p>

      <div class="app-example app-example--tag">
        {% include "includes/card-variants/accessibility-heading-class.html" %}
      </div>
