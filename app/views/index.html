      <h1>Component test</h1>

      <p>A combination of the styles, components and guidance in response to a particular problem makes a design pattern.</p>
      <p>In the NHS.UK frontend and NHS digital service manual there are a number of components that should be design patterns, which could also be built differently using a combination of styles and components, without changing the look and feel.</p>
      <p>The benefits of doing this include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>reducing the size of the codebase, making it easier to maintain</li>
        <li>increasing the flexibility of the design system</li>
        <li>giving clearer context of usage, by making design patterns</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It would be a breaking change, meaning users of the frontend would need to manually update their projects with the latest code, so we need to take that into consideration.</p>

      <h2>Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/do-dont-list">Do and don't list</a></li>
        <li><a href="/list-panel">List panel</a></li>
      </ul>
