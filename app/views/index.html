      <h1>Refactoring components</h1>

      <h2>What</h2>
      <p>A combination of the styles, components and guidance in response to a particular problem makes a design pattern.</p>
      <p>In the service manual there are a number of components that could become design patterns and be built differently using a combination of existing styles and components.</p>

      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>This work would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>reduce the size of the codebase (the NHS.UK frontend), making it easier to maintain</li>
        <li>increase the versatility of the design system, with resuable styles and components</li>
        <li>give users clearer context of usage, with design patterns</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> It would be a breaking change, meaning users of the frontend would need to manually update their projects with the latest code, so it all needs to be considered carefully.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Components to refactor</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/do-dont-list">Do and don't list</a></li>
        <li><a href="/list-panel">List panel</a></li>
        <li><a href="/review-date">Review date</a></li>
      </ul>
