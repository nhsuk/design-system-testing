            <p>Acrivastine is a medicine called an antihistamine.</p>
            <p>When you come into contact with something you're allergic to, such as pollen, animal hair or fur, house dust, or insect bites and stings, your body produces a chemical called histamine.</p>
            <p>Usually histamine is a useful substance, but in an allergic reaction it causes unpleasant symptoms including itchy, watery eyes, a running or blocked nose, sneezing and skin rashes.</p>
            <p>Acrivastine blocks the effects of histamine and reduces these symptoms.</p>

            <p>It depends on why you're taking acrivastine.</p>
            <p>You may only need to take it as a one-off dose or for a day or two - for example, if you have a reaction to an insect bite.</p>
            <p>You may need to take acrivastine for longer if you're taking it to prevent symptoms - for example, to stop hay fever when the pollen count is high.</p>
